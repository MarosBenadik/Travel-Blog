        <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”, “policy”) outlines how personal information is collected, used, and distributed by AwayFromROutineAPP LIMITED with its registered office: 1-3 WORSHIP STREET, 2ND FLOOR, C/O BUCKWORTHS, LONDON, EC2A 2AB, and all its affiliate companies, subsidiaries, and employees (“AwayFromROutine”, “we”, “our” or “us”). This Privacy Policy applies to all the users and customers (individually referred to as “You”) of AwayFromROutine websites, applications, and other online services (together, our “Platform”).

            When you use our Platform, you are trusting us with your information that could identify you, such as your name, gender, email address, address, other contact details or online identifiers, other information, and content that you provide to us when using the Platform ("Personal Information" or “information”). Please take time to read this policy carefully where we try to explain in more detail how we work to ensure your personal information is kept secure and in compliance with the relevant laws.

            For the purposes of data protection law AwayFromROutine will be the data controller for your information. You can write to us at: 1-3 WORSHIP STREET, 2ND FLOOR, C/O BUCKWORTHS, LONDON, EC2A 2AB or email us at: hello@AwayFromROutineapp.com.

            Due to the nature of our business other third parties that we work with and include on our Platform (“Partner/s” or “Bloger/s”) with whom you may choose to book appointments and where you might make purchases from, as well as other social networks that you use in connection with our Platform, may also collect, use, and share information about you. This Privacy Policy does not cover such third parties or their services. For more information about how they collect, use, and disclose your data, please consult with them directly.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            When you contact, visit and/or use our Platform, we may collect information in various ways. We use this information to, among other things, provide the functionality, improve the quality of, and personalize your experience on our platform. The information we may collect includes:
        </p>
        <li>Personal Information and content that you choose to share with us when you create an account, subscribe to our emails and notifications, and when using our Platform, including information provided when making bookings, purchases, creating social content and engaging in other social activities such as, but not limited to, posts, questions, answers, likes, comments, following, reviews, and survey responses. When you upload content (for example, submitting questions), book appointments or submit reviews, you might voluntarily provide us with sensitive personal information if relevant to the purpose of the feature, and service that you are requesting or reviewing.</li>
        <li>Personal Information that you share with us as part of your application for a job at AwayFromROutine, submitted directly, through our Platform, or indirectly, including but not limited to, via a recruitment agency, unsolicited application, or a third-party recruitment entity. While making an application you may choose to voluntarily provide us with sensitive personal information relating to whether reasonable adjustments should be made for you in the application process or subsequently if an employment relationship is established. However, you must NOT share any sensitive personal information with us that would not be necessary for us to make reasonable adjustments for you (e.g. your political opinions, financial situation, or specific information about your health).</li>
        <li>Where you are using our online payment processing feature, we may store (via ourselves or our appointed third-party payment processor) your credit and/or debit card details in a secure and encrypted location.</li>
        <li>If you choose to communicate with us (e.g. through our Platform, live chat, email, telephone, SMS, or social media etc.) we will keep records of such interaction, its content, your contact details, and other unique identifiers including IP address and your full name.</li>
        <li>Information about your use of the Platform, such as information about the device and a browser that you are using, your IP address and location, your identifier for advertisers (IDFA), number of visits, the date, time and duration of your visit, the referral source and navigation paths on the Platform, as well as other interactions on the Platform including the Partners/Blogers you are interested in, content and profiles you browse, like, pin, comment, and share. Please note that we may link this information with your AwayFromROutine account.</li>
        <li>Information that we may also obtain from other sources, such as third-party websites, applications, and services (each, a “Third-Party Platform”), through which you connect to our Platform. We may also obtain information from our Partners (subject to our Terms & Conditions Agreement with them and their policies) about your use of their services. Together we may choose to integrate such information from Third-Party Platforms and our Partners with the information we collect on our Platform.</li>
        <p>It is extremely important that all the Personal Information you give us when registering for an account on our Platform, or otherwise when you use it, is correct and accurate. This includes, by way of example only, ensuring that we always have your correct contact details.

            If you plan to provide someone else's Personal Information on our Platform, for example when making a booking on their behalf, you should only provide us with that third party's details with their consent and after they have been given access to information about how we will use their details, including the purposes set out in this policy.
        </p>
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age (please see the Terms of Use of our Platform). In the case we discover that a child under 13 years old has provided us with personal information, we do our best to discover and immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to take the necessary actions to remove such information.
        </p>
        <h2>Device Information</h2>
        <p>
            As outlined earlier, we gather information in various ways from the devices you choose to use our Platform on, and we combine this information across different devices you use. We apply the information collected to personalise the content (including advertisements) or features that you see when you use our Platform on another device, such as your laptop or a tablet. It is important to say that many companies in their privacy policies are obliged to list all kinds of data that they may collect when users are using their platforms, however it does not mean that all of it is collected and will be used as it depends on many factors, such as the operating system that the Platform is being used on or whether the Platform has been granted the necessary permissions by the user on their device.

            Hence, the Information that we collect from these devices will or may include:
        </p>
        <li>Device attributes - information such as the operating system, hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage space, browser type, app and file names and types, as well as plugins.</li>
        <li>Device operations - information about operations and behaviours performed on the device, for example whether the app open is in the foreground or background, mouse movements or swipes (which can help distinguish humans from bots).</li>
        <li>Identifiers - unique identifiers, device IDs and other identifiers, such as from games, apps, or accounts that you use, and other identifiers unique to our Platform.</li>
        <li>Device signals - Bluetooth signals, information about nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons, and mobile phone masts.</li>
        <li>Data from device settings - information you allow us to receive through device settings that you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera, or photos.</li>
        <li>Network and connection - information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things such as help you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</li>
        <li>Cookie data - data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the section “How We Collect Information” below.</li>
        <h2>How We Collect Information</h2>
        <p>
            Like other commercial websites and applications, our Platform uses standard technologies including cookies and similar tools like web server logs, web beacons, tokens, pixel tags, local storage, device identifiers and tracking IDs (together referred to as "Cookies") to enhance your user experience, provide personalized content, functionality, and services (including advertisements), and to improve our Platform.
        </p>
        <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small text files containing a string of characters that can be placed on your computer or mobile device, which uniquely identify your browser or device. We may use technologies such as cookies, pixels, and local storage to deliver, secure and understand products, services, and ads.</p>
        <h2>What are cookies used for?</h2>
        <p>Cookies and other technologies allow a site or services to know if your computer or device has visited it before. These technologies can then be used to deliver products, services, and ads, help us understand how the site or service is being used, help you navigate between pages efficiently, help us remember your preferences and generally improve your experience of using our services. Cookies can also help us ensure that marketing you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
        <h2>Why does AwayFromROutine use cookies and similar technologies?</h2>
        <p>We use cookies, pixels, local storage, and similar technologies to show you relevant content, improve your experience and help protect AwayFromROutine and our users. We may use these technologies to deliver the service, provide you with a service that is easy to use, enable you to move around the service and use its features, such as accessing secure areas, and store information so that AwayFromROutine responds faster. We may use these technologies to collect information about how you use the service, for example which pages you go to most often and whether you get error messages from certain pages. We may use these technologies to allow us to remember choices you make (such as your username, language, or the region you are in) and tailor what you see on our Platform to provide enhanced features and content. These cookies can also be used to remember changes that you have made to the text size, font, and other parts of pages that you can customise. AwayFromROutine or our advertising partners may use these technologies to deliver advertising that is relevant to your interests. These technologies can remember that your device has visited a site or service and may also be able to track your device's browsing activity on other sites or services other than AwayFromROutine. This information may be shared with organisations outside AwayFromROutine, such as advertisers and/or advertising networks to deliver the advertising, and to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.</p>
        <h2>How long will cookies stay on my device?</h2>
        <p>The length of time that a cookie will stay on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you close your browser. Persistent cookies stay on your computer or mobile device until they expire or are deleted.</p>
        <h2>First- and third-party cookies</h2>
        <p>First-party cookies are cookies that belong to AwayFromROutine. Third-party cookies are cookies that another party places on your device through our Platform. Third-party cookies may be placed on your device by someone providing advertising, measurement, marketing, and analytics services to AwayFromROutine, or to provide certain features and improve our services for you. For example, other companies' cookies can help us understand how our service is being used. Third-party cookies may also be placed on your device by our business partners so that they can use them to advertise products and services to you elsewhere on the Internet, to measure the performance and effectiveness of those ads, and to support marketing and analytics.</p>
        <h2>Remarketing Cookies</h2>
        <p>You may notice that sometimes, after visiting a website, you see increased numbers of adverts from the site you visited. That is because the website you visited has placed a cookie on your web browser. Using that cookie and web analytics tools, the website owner will be able to show you adverts on third-party websites that they think you might be interested in. This cookie does not give access to your computer or mobile device but may be able to identify you from other details.</p>
        <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
        <p>AwayFromROutine products and services use Google Analytics to show relevant adverts to users who have previously visited us as they browse the web. This enables us to tailor our marketing to better suit your needs and only display ads that are relevant to you. You may see AwayFromROutine or one of our Partners in search results pages (using Google Adwords), on YouTube, in banner adverts on Gmail and on other services run by Google. Any information collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy - https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB&gl=uk. If you do not wish to see ads, you can:

            Opt out of Google’s use of cookies through Google’s Ads Settings - <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/data-and-personalization">Google </a>
            Refuse the use of cookies by downloading and installing Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on - <a href='https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en'>Google. </a>
        </p>
        <h2>Facebook Remarketing</h2>
        <p>
            We also use similar targeted advertising technology from Facebook to ensure that we only serve people with adverts on their Facebook pages that are relevant to them. To enable us to do this, we include a piece of code on our websites, called the Facebook Pixel. The information collected, for example which pages you visited, which device you used and what actions you took, will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy, as well as Facebook’s privacy policies. The Facebook Pixel only lasts for sixty (60) days. Using the Facebook Pixel, we can also remarket adverts to you through Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. You can set preferences for how Facebook advertises to you using your Facebook ad preferences feature: <a href='https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/advertisers/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen'>HERE</a>
        </p>
        <h2>How can you control cookies?</h2>
        <p>
            We use cookies to help personalise and improve content and services, provide a safer experience and to show you useful and relevant ads on and off AwayFromROutine platform. You can control how we use data to show you ads and more by using the tools described below.

            If you have a AwayFromROutine account, you can manage your privacy/cookies settings in your app Settings.
            If you do not have a AwayFromROutine account or are not logged in to your account, you can manage cookies from other companies or AwayFromROutine on your browser. Follow the instructions provided by your web or mobile browser (usually located within the "Help", "Tools" or "Edit" facility) to control our cookies on other apps and websites, and cookies from other companies on AwayFromROutine. Please note that if you set your browser to disable cookies or other technologies, you may not be able to access certain parts of our Platform at all and/or other parts of our Platform may not work properly.

            In addition, your browser or device may offer settings that allow you to choose whether browser cookies are set and to delete them. These controls vary by browser and manufacturers may change both the settings they make available and how they work at any time. You can refuse to accept some or all cookies by modifying settings within your browser. For guidance on how to do this, please visit <a href='http://www.aboutcookies.org'>HERE</a>.

This information will be held for a period of 12 months and may be referred to should you make future applications to work at AwayFromROutine again, unless you opt to delete this data which you may do so by submitting an application or sending us an email with a request to remove the data, we have collected about you during the job application process.
            Your information will be treated in accordance with applicable data protection law at all times.
        </p>
        <h2>Legitimate Interests</h2>
        <h4>We may rely on legitimate interests to process your personal information, provided that your interests do not override our own. Where we rely on legitimate interests, these interests are:</h4>
        <li>Providing, maintaining, and improving our Platform to meet the needs of our End Users and Blogers;</li>
        <li>Understanding how the services on our Platform are used to improve its performance in the future;</li>
        <li>Customising the Platform to provide you with a better user experience;</li>
        <li>Marketing to inform End Users and Blogers about other services We offer that might benefit or interest them;</li>
        <li>Providing advertising;</li>
        <li>Detecting, preventing, or otherwise addressing fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues with our service, applying sufficient safeguards against threats, harassment or bullying, particularly toward minors; and</li>
        <li>Enforcing legal claims.</li>
        <h1>Storage and Retention</h1>
        <h2>
            Where we store your personal information
        </h2>
        <p>We are a company based in the United Kingdom. Our data is mostly hosted and stored within the European Economic Area or with business partners protected by Privacy Shield agreements. When necessary, the information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and may also be processed by staff operating outside the United Kingdom or the EEA who work for us or for one of our Blogers. When data is transferred outside of the UK or EEA, we will take all measures to ensure that any transferred personal information is treated securely and in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
        <h2>
            Data retention, account deactivation and deletion
        </h2>
        <p>
            AwayFromROutine will store personal data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and products and for as long as it is permitted by applicable law, or until your account is deleted. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, if you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated.

            When you delete your account, we delete your personal profile and data around it, such as your photos, personal details, service catalogue and historic information about your and/or your clients’ bookings, and you won't be able to recover this information later. However, your comments, likes, questions and answers may still be visible to others but will not be identifiable (i.e., other users will not be able to tell if it was you as your account will be no longer accessible and personal data no longer identifiable/removed). Information that others have shared about you is not part of your account and will not be deleted.

            Our data retention policy only covers the Personal Information that we collect about you when you choose to use our Platform and we are not responsible for how Blogers, and other Third Parties choose to retain your data. For more information about how they collect, use, and disclose your data, and how you can request for your data to be removed from their books and/or systems please contact them directly.
        </p>
        <h2>Disclosing Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We share your information with others in the following ways:</p>
        <h2>Accounts that you share and communicate with</h2>
        <p>When you share and communicate using our Platform, you choose what type of content you want others to see (e.g., photo/video, description, question/answer, or services listed under your profile as an Bloger). For example, when you post a question on AwayFromROutine, you can select whether the question will be visible publicly or anonymously. Similarly, when you use our Platform to post content or to communicate with other users or Blogers, those people and businesses can see the content you send them or tag them in. Your network can also see actions that you have taken on our Platform, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We may also let other accounts to see who has viewed their content or certain parts of their Profile.

            As a normal user you can set your account to be public or private, whereas Blogers’ accounts are always Public. Those accounts that are public can be seen by anyone, on or off our Platform, including if they do not have an account. This includes your AwayFromROutine username, display name, occupation, any information you share with a public audience, information in your public profile on our Platform, and content you create on our AwayFromROutine marketplace and/or questions and answers you submit publicly.

            You, other people using our Platform, and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or off our Platform, including in other AwayFromROutine products or services, in search results or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Platform.</p>
        <h2>Content that others share or reshare about you</h2>
        <p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Platform can choose to share it with others on and off our Platform. For example, when you share a post or send a private message to specific accounts, they can download, screenshot or reshare that content to others on or off our Platform, or in person. Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content.

            People can also use our Platform to create and share content about you with others. For example, people can share a photo of you in a post, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts, questions/answers, or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Platform, you can choose to report this content.</p>
        <h2>Information about your presence on our Platform</h2>
        <p>People in your networks may be able to see signals telling them whether you are active on our Platform, including whether you are currently active on AwayFromROutine mobile app or when you last used our Platform.</p>
        <h2>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations using our Platform</h2>
        <p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Platform, they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you book an appointment with an Bloger, leave a review, comment, or share something linked to a particular service provider (i.e., Bloger) we may share this information about your activities with that Bloger. Also, if you have signed up on a third-party website using our Platform, we may also share this information with them.

            Similarly, when you download or use any third-party services linked to our Platform, they can access your public profile, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites that you use may receive your list of followers and/or service catalogue if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites that you use will not be able to receive any other information about your followers from you (although your followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.</p>
        <h2>Third-party Payment Processor</h2>
        <p>We may also use a third-party payment processor, to process all payments made by you on our Platform. In such instance, AwayFromROutine does not store credit card details and instead relies on a third-party for this. We obtain limited information from our third-party such as the last four digits, the country of issuance and the expiration date. The processing of such data by our third-party payment processor is covered by their own privacy policy. If you would like to find out more about our third-party payment processor and how they collect, use, and disclose your data please email us at: hello@AwayFromROutineapp.com.</p>
        <h2>Your rights</h2>
        <h4>Regarding the personal information, we hold about you, you may be entitled to ask us:</h4>
        <li>For a copy of your personal information</li>
        <li>To rectify, or restrict the processing of your Personal Information</li>
        <li>To exercise your right to be forgotten, which allows you to have your Personal Information removed in certain circumstances (though this is not an absolute right and may not apply if we need to continue using it for a lawful reason)</li>
        <li>To obtain personal data which you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine-readable format and to ask us to transfer this information to another organisation</li>
        <li>To object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we do not have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the data for direct marketing).</li>
        <p>
            In the first instance you may be able to view or change the information you have provided us with by logging in to your account on our Platform. Your rights in relation to your Personal Information are limited in some situations. For example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person or if we have a legal requirement or a compelling legitimate ground, we may continue to process Personal Information which you have asked us to delete. You also may have the right to make a complaint if you feel your personal information has been mishandled.
